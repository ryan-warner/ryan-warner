### Hi there 👋  My name is Ryan Warner! 

- 🛩  I'm currently studying Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, with a minor in Computer Science
- 📍 My account is basically a collection of personal and school projects, in various stages of development. I wouldn't call myself a professional by any means, but hopefully I've made some things that people might be able to use. Feel free to dig around!
- 📱 Get in touch! I'm most reachable by email or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/warner-ryan), both should be accesible from GitHub, or from my [personal site](https://ryanwarner.app)

#### Current Projects
- I'm currently working on Filmstrip! I shoot a little bit of film in my free time, and wanted to build a site where film could be uploaded, stored, and shared, all on its own. It's my first true full-stack project, and I'm really excited to see things starting to come together. 
- Also spend some time this summer working on a recreation of GitHub's globe on the homepage, currently in my [Flight Log](https://github.com/ryan-warner/Flight-Log) repository. I'll break the globe into a separate component one of these days, but the intention is for Flight Log to be a way for people to track and visualise the flights they've taken over the years.
